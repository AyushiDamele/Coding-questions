Given a string  of length . Now, you need to cut the string  into  non-empty substrings by performing  cuts. There are lots of ways of performing the cuts in the string . For every way of performing the cuts, you need to count how many substrings will be a palindrome in that way of cut. You need to sum this count over all possible ways of cutting the string .

Input Format

The first line contains two integers  and  as input.
The second line contains the string  as input.

Output Format

In the output, you need to print the sum modulo .

Constraints
2<=N<=5000
1<=K<=N-1 


String  contains only lowercase english alphabets

Sample Input
5 2
aabbc
Sample Output
12
Explanation
In the given test case there are  ways to perform the cuts. All the ways are described below.

a | a | bbc = 2 substrings are palindrome

a | ab | bc =1  substring is palindrome

a | abb | c =2  substrings are palindrome

aa | b | bc =2  substrings are palindrome

aa | bb | c =3  substrings are palindrome

aab | b | c =2  substrings are palindrome

So, the output is 2+1+2+2+3+2=12.
